	<strong>Fish Farm</strong><br/>
	</p>
Fish farming or pisciculture involves raising fish commercially in tanks or enclosures such as fish ponds, usually for food.
 It is the principal form of aquaculture, while other methods may fall under mariculture.<br/><br/> A facility that releases juvenile fish

 into the wild for recreational fishing or to supplement a species' natural numbers is generally referred to as a fish hatchery.
 Worldwide, the most important fish species produced in fish farming are carp, tilapia, salmon, and catfish.<br/><br/>

Demand is increasing for fish and fish protein, which has resulted in widespread overfishing in wild fisheries. 
China provides 62% of the world's farmed fish.As of 2016, more than 50% of seafood was produced by aquaculture.<br/><br/>

Farming carnivorous fish, such as salmon, does not always reduce pressure on wild fisheries. 
Carnivorous farmed fish are usually fed fishmeal and fish oil extracted from wild forage fish. <br/><br/>
The 2008 global returns for fish farming recorded by the FAO totaled 33.8 million tonnes worth about $US 60 billion.
